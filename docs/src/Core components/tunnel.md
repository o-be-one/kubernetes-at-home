# Tunnel

## Public access

As my network will allow local area network access by default, I've setup a [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide) to allow public access to selected apps. Cloudflare will hide my IP and it's enabled CDN (proxy) that includes several security features like WAF, DDoS protection, etc.
