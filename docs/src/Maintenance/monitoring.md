# Monitoring

## Netdata

Netdata is a highly performant monitoring and troubleshooting tool for Linux. My choice is motivated by the fact that it's opensource and self-hosted, with deep integration with Kubernetes and deep observability. This one will be used only locally. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/netdata/netdata).
